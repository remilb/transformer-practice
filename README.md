# Monad Transformer Practice

Trying to grok monad transformers by implementing a few. This essentially turned into a partial implementation of the [**transformers**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers) package as well as some of the typeclasses from **mtl** (using a mix 
of functional dependencies and type families in order to get a taste  of both flavors). But I did it with my eyes closed (mostly)! 
Actually quite a helpful exercise that I would recommend to anyone trying to learn monad transformers; it was almost... transformative.
