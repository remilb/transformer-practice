# Monad Transformer Practice

Trying to grok monad transformers by implementing a few. This essentially turned into a partial implementation of the [**transformers**](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers) package. But I did it with my eyes closed! Actually quite a helpful exercise that I would recommend to anyone trying to learn monad transformers; it was almost... transformative.
